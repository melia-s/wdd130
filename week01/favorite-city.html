        Salt-Lake City, Utah
    </h1>
    <p>
        I love Salt-Lake City, Utah because of the beautiful mountain ranges. The city was built
        by people from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. One of the most famous buildings in Salt-Lake
        City is the Salt-Lake temple, which took
        around forty years to build. It is now under construction to bring it up to code, and to restore it.
