        <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its stunning natural landscapes and diverse geography. Home to Salt
            Lake City, the state's capital and largest city, Utah has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Native
            American history and Latter-Day Saint pioneers (from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints). It's
            a hub for outdoor recreation, offering world-class
            skiing, hiking, and
            mountain biking. Utah is also famous for the Great Salt Lake, one of the largest saltwater lakes in the
            Western
            Hemisphere.</p>
