            <p>Hello! My name is Melia Stringham and I am from Orem, Utah. I was born in 2003 and I am currently 22
                years
                old.
                I enjoy reading, crafting (i.e. knitting, drawing, embroidery, painting, etc.), styling hair, and doing
                makeup (I like to
                do SFX makeup the most, but I enjoy typical beauty makeup as well). I swam in competitions when I was
                little, but now I enjoy learing martial arts. I am
                currently studying Web Design and Software Development through BYU Pathway. I look forward to improving
                my
                skills through creating this website.
            </p>

            <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its stunning natural landscapes and diverse geography. Home to
                Salt
                Lake City, the state's capital and largest city, Utah has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Native
                American history and Latter-Day Saint pioneers (from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints).
                It's
                a hub for outdoor recreation, offering world-class
                skiing, hiking, and
                mountain biking. Utah is also famous for the Great Salt Lake, one of the largest saltwater lakes in the
                Western
                Hemisphere.</p>
